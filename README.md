## Git vs. GitHub

Git, the code we use within terms of planning and forming ideas. Git is the base of the coding used via Github, this means that Git can't exist without Github. However Github can exist without Git as Github is a cloud system. A cloud system is a form of storage and it's used to hold information online. This means that Github can store code from Git and even other websites (Example: Cloud9)  
  
Examples of using Git would be a piece of code referred to as ``git init``. This example will be explained better in ***Initial Setup***.

## Initial Setup

So you made it this far? Not bad, but things are probably gonna get more complex fromm here on out. When Initialing. you need a directory to work in ( Usually ``~/workspace``) and to initialize a directory, you would use this little piece of code titled ``git init``. Now I bet you're thinking, can't I just use it without the space in the middle. The answer is no, that space is required to actually have the code function. Let's dive into the basics shall we? 

``Codes``  

``git init`` - When you start up the system, you can either cd (Check the code snippet cd for more info) into your directory. This code is used to give the directory the function of master, which is basically empowering it. When you used ``git init`` the directory should say ``~/workspace/directory_name (master)``. This means the code worked and you want to make sure you intialized the right directory because there is a git uninit. 

``touch`` - So you're inside the directory and now you wanna write something, maybe a love letter? Well I'm sure you're thinking "Time to use git file or git create."
